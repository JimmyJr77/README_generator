## Description
#### Motivation:
To automate the process of creating a well-structured README for projects.

#### Why Build:
To save time and effort for developers when documenting their projects.

#### Problem Solved:
Manual README creation can be tedious and error-prone.

#### What Was Learned:
Improved knowledge of Node.js, Inquirer library, and Markdown syntax.

## Installation Instructions
#### Step 1:
Clone the repository from GitHub.

#### Step 2:
Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.

#### Step 3:
Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Usage
#### Example 1:
When a contributor selects a specific license badge, that badge will appear at the top of the README, just under the title. A link to the README build video is also presented at the top.

#### Example 2:
If the user does not have a badge to display, they can select  "None of the Above" when prompted and enter their own  information regarding the license. If no badge is available as a result of this, the contributor will see a message at the top of the README that directs them to the License section for more information.

#### Example 3:
The user is able to provide instruction and examples without a photo...

#### Example 4:
...and the README Generator smoothly transitions to the next example. The user can terminate any lists by returning a blank response to the appropriate question.
